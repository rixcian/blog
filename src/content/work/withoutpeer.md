I was working on a platform ([zakonyzavcas.cz](https://zakonyzavcas.cz)) as a solo developer for watching on regulatory changes in the Czech Republic. Clients were automatically receiving email notifications when new changes specific to their industry were published.

The platform was managed by a law firm, so I was also working on the backend for their internal tools.

The platform was built with Laravel on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend.
