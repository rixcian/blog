Working on intuitive cyber-security protection platform for all company devices, networks, and users.

This platform is able to find vulnerabilities connected to the company devices, networks, and users. It is also able to help with education of the users and prepare the company for cyber-security certifications and audits for regulatory purposes in a automated way (like NIS2, ISO 27001, etc.).

I implemented the whole frontend for the platform where customer's administrators are able to manage all company devices, networks, users, and policies.

In 2023 I was given another role as a Development Manager. I'm responsible for the development team and the development process on a daily basis.

In 2024 I started to work on a desktop applications for the platform based on Electron (both for Windows and Mac platforms).
